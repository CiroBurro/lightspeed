## Entries

### 2026-05-25: Initial Decision Log Created

**Agent:** Architect
**Status:** Accepted
**Rationale:** The WAT autonomy system was incomplete — `wat/rules.md`, `wat/archive/agents.md`, and `wat/state/decisions.md` were referenced by `AGENTS.md` but did not exist. Created all three files to establish the canonical autonomy loop foundation.
**Impact:** AI agents can now follow the full WAT autonomy loop: read state → adopt persona → execute task → verify → update state. All policy stubs (`[COST_STUB]`, `[SAFETY_STUB]`, etc.) are now enforced.
**Alternatives Considered:** Stripping WAT references from AGENTS.md — rejected because the autonomy loop adds value for multi-agent coordination.

### 2026-05-25: Protocol Documentation Correction — v2 Header Size

**Agent:** QAEngineer
**Status:** Accepted
**Rationale:** `docs/protocol.md` stated v2 header is "20 + 6 = 26 bytes" but the FEC header in `protocol/src/fec.rs` is `FEC_HEADER_SIZE = 4`, making v2 total 24 bytes. The v1 diagram also labeled byte 1 as "Reserved" instead of "Session Token" (changed in code since v0.3.0). Corrected all values in protocol.md.
**Impact:** Protocol documentation now accurately reflects the wire format. Wire format examples updated to show 4-byte FEC extension (was 6 bytes).
**Alternatives Considered:** Changing FEC header to 6 bytes — rejected because the 4-byte format is already deployed and more efficient.

### 2026-05-25: Quinn Upgrade to 0.11.14 — RUSTSEC-2026-0037

**Agent:** SecOps
**Status:** Accepted
**Rationale:** `quinn-proto 0.11.13` has a known DoS advisory (RUSTSEC-2026-0037). `quinn 0.11.14` is a patch release that fixes this. Upgraded via `cargo update -p quinn-proto`.
**Impact:** Resolved the `quinn-proto` DoS advisory. The `quinn` dependency is specified as `"0.11"` so automatic resolution picks up the patch. Advisory entry in `.cargo/audit.toml` can be removed once `cargo-audit` confirms the fix.
**Alternatives Considered:** Upgrading to quinn 0.12 — rejected because it requires code changes to the QUIC control plane (zero test coverage).

### 2026-05-25: Clippy Configuration Established

**Agent:** RustDev
**Status:** Accepted
**Rationale:** The project had no `clippy.toml`, relying on tool defaults. Created `.clippy.toml` with `cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30` and `too-many-arguments-threshold = 8` to catch complexity creep early.
**Impact:** Future `cargo clippy` runs will flag methods exceeding these thresholds. Existing code unaffected until thresholds are lowered.
**Alternatives Considered:** More aggressive thresholds (20/6) — rejected to avoid breaking existing code without prior fixes.

### 2026-05-25: Decommissioned Infrastructure Cleanup

**Agent:** InfraDev
**Status:** Accepted
**Rationale:** `infra/terraform/` (OCI configs) and `infra/fly/` (never-deployed Fly.io config) are dead code. Moved to `infra/archive/` with a README explaining their historical status.
**Impact:** Reduced confusion about which infrastructure is active. The active deployment uses Vultr (managed via `infra/scripts/` and `infra/docker/`).
**Alternatives Considered:** Deleting outright — rejected because the Terraform configs contain useful reference patterns for future migrations.



### 2026-05-25: CLI and Config Unit Tests Added

**Agent:** QAEngineer
**Status:** Accepted
**Rationale:** `client/src/cli.rs` and `client/src/config.rs` had zero unit tests. Added comprehensive test coverage: 22 CLI tests (default values, all flag combinations, game values, parse_proxy_addr error cases) and 16 config tests (defaults, TOML round-trip, partial config, invalid TOML, file save/load round-trip).
**Impact:** Total test count increased from ~111 to ~137. CLI breakage and silent config bugs are now caught by the test suite.
**Alternatives Considered:** Using clap's built-in test utilities specifically — rejected because clap derive's `try_parse_from` provides more natural API testing.

### 2026-05-25: Protocol Documentation Fully Corrected

**Agent:** QAEngineer
**Status:** Accepted
**Rationale:** Completed all protocol doc fixes from the audit. Every reference to v2 header size (26→24 bytes), FEC extension size (6→4 bytes), v1 diagram field name (Reserved→Session Token), and all wire format examples now match the actual implementation in `protocol/src/fec.rs` (FEC_HEADER_SIZE = 4).
**Impact:** Protocol documentation is now a single source of truth. Wire format examples correctly show 4-byte FEC extension at offset 0x14-0x17 with payload starting at 0x18.
**Alternatives Considered:** Reverting FEC header to 6 bytes to match old docs — rejected because 4-byte format is deployed and more efficient.
